The Bible Is An Extrodenary Book. To Read It Is Inportant.

Everyone needs The Bible.

"For All Have Sinned, and Come Short Of The Glory of God." Romans 3:22

Now You Might Be Asking "Why Would I Need The Bible." Or "Why/How Would I Have Sin?"

Have You Ever Lied?
Have You Ever Stolen?
Have You Ever Murdered? The Bible Says Hate Is The Same As Murder In God's Eyes.
Now You Might Say "Now Wait Wait Wait, Again, Why Would I Need The Bible? And Here You Are Bring Up The Bible Again."
So Your tennicly Saying The Bible Isn't True. if One Part Of The Bible Isn't True, Then All Of The Bible Isn't True:
  "The Words Of The Lord Are Pure Words: As Silver Tried On A Furnace of Earth, Purified Seven times. Thou Shalt Keep Them, O Lord, Theu shalt Preserve Them From This Generation For Ever." Psalms 12:6-7
